            <h1>OLED vs QLED TVs</h1>
            <h2>OLED TVs</h2>
            <p>OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diodes) TVs offer a superior image quality thanks to their ability to display true blacks. Each pixel in an OLED display is individually lit, meaning it can be turned off completely to produce a true black. This results in an infinite contrast ratio, and allows for a very thin screen.</p>
            <h3>Pros of OLED TVs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Superior image quality with true blacks</li>
                <li>Fast refresh rate, ideal for sports and fast action movies</li>
                <li>Thin and lightweight design</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cons of OLED TVs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Can be more expensive than other types of TVs</li>
                <li>Longevity could be less than LED TVs</li>
                <li>Screen burn-in could be a potential issue with static images</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>QLED TVs</h2>
            <p>QLED (Quantum Dot LED) TVs are a variation of LED LCD TVs â€” they use a quantum dot filter that increases the color range and brightness. QLED TVs can't produce true blacks like OLEDs, but they can get brighter, which makes them a better choice for a bright room.</p>
            <h3>Pros of QLED TVs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Brighter than OLED TVs, making them a good choice for bright rooms</li>
                <li>Long lifespan</li>
                <li>Less risk of burn-in compared to OLED</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cons of QLED TVs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Can't produce true blacks like OLED TVs</li>
                <li>Viewing angles are not as wide as OLED TVs</li>
                <li>Heavier and thicker than OLED TVs</li>
            </ul>
